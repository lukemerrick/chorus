# chorus
Project attempting to simulate choral pitch-matching
Code based off of a subset of the old (python-musical)[https://code.google.com/archive/p/python-musical/downloads] library.

## Note
This was a one-off project for a simulation and modeling course. Although there may be some merit to this approach and the code built out for it, it's pretty disorganized since it was from day one not budgeted a large amount of development time or planned for further work.
